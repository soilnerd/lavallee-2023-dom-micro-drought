region,"Sampling sites were clustered into three broader regions. De = Devon; Sc = Aberdeenshire, Scotland; Yo = North Yorkshire",,,,
site,"Site ID within each region. Sites are numbered south to north, with 1 being the southernmost site and 5 being the northernmost site.",,,,
management,"Management regime within a site/farm. In = intensive; Ex = extensive. Management regimes are all relative to each farm, but in general, extensive sites receive little or no fertilizer or lime and are not cut for hay.",,,,
treatment,Drought treatment. C = control; D = droughted (shelters),,,,
plot,"Replicate plot pair number, 1-3, within each field. Three drought shelters, and three paired control plots, were established in each field. Therefore, Cp1 is paired with Dp1, etc. ",,,,
day,"Time of measurement, in days after shelter removal. Day 0 = day of drought shelter removal, etc. until 60 days after shelter removal. Day 0 and 60 correspond to different dates for each site.",,,,
lat,Decimal latitude of plot,,,,
lon,Decimal longitude of plot,,,,
sand_pct,"Percent sand (>53 microns), determined by laser granulometry at University of Manchester. Prior to analysis, soil samples were sieved at 2 mm and oven dried. They were subsampled by riffle sampler, followed by cone and quarter to achieve a sample size of c. 0.75 grams. To remove organic matter, the samples were boiled in 50 ml hydrogen peroxide H2O2 (@ 120 °C) for >2 hours, with the aim of finishing when the samples had stopped reacting and had become bleached in colour. The entire sub-sample was then analyzed using a Malvern Mastersizer 2000 and Hydro 2000G liquid handling unit.",%,,,
